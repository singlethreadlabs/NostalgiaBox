"""Randomized, no-boring-repeats playlist ordering.

Old TV was appointment viewing on a schedule; this box instead plays each
channel on an endless shuffle. A naive "pick a random file every time" feels
wrong: it will happily play the same episode twice in a row and can go a long
time without touching some episodes. A *shuffle bag* fixes both problems.

The bag holds one copy of every episode. It hands them out in a random order
until the bag is empty, then refills and reshuffles - guaranteeing every
episode plays once before any repeats (just like dragging a season into a music
player and hitting "shuffle"). When it refills, it also makes sure the first
episode of the new shuffle is not the same as the last one played, so you never
see the same episode back-to-back across a cycle boundary.
